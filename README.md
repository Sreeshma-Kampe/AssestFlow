# 📖 Overview

**AssetFlow** is a modern **Enterprise Asset & Resource Management System (ERP)** that enables organizations to efficiently manage physical assets, shared resources, maintenance operations, audits, and employee allocations from a centralized platform.

Instead of relying on spreadsheets and paper records, AssetFlow provides real-time visibility into asset ownership, availability, lifecycle, maintenance, bookings, and operational analytics.

The platform is designed for:

- 🏢 Corporate Offices
- 🏫 Universities & Schools
- 🏥 Hospitals
- 🏭 Manufacturing Industries
- 🏛 Government Organizations
- 🚚 Logistics Companies
- 🏬 Enterprises

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Organizations often struggle with:

- Manual spreadsheet-based asset tracking
- Double allocation of assets
- Booking conflicts
- Poor maintenance scheduling
- Missing audit trails
- Lost assets
- No centralized visibility
- Lack of accountability
- Inefficient approval workflows

AssetFlow solves these challenges through a scalable ERP platform that provides structured workflows for asset management, maintenance, bookings, audits, notifications, and reporting.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

## Frontend

- Next.js 15
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI

## Backend

- Next.js API Routes
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL
- JWT Authentication

## Database

- PostgreSQL

## Data Storage

### PostgreSQL (Primary Database)

Stores all application data:

- Users
- Departments
- Employees
- Assets
- Categories
- Bookings
- Maintenance Requests
- Audit Cycles
- Notifications
- Activity Logs
- Reports
- File Metadata

### Document Storage

Asset images and documents are stored in a local `/uploads` directory during development. Their metadata (file name, path, MIME type, uploader, upload date, and associated asset) is stored in PostgreSQL using Prisma ORM.

> In a production deployment, the `/uploads` directory can be replaced with an object storage service (such as Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage) without changing the application's core business logic.

---

# 🚫 Project Constraints

This project intentionally avoids third-party Backend-as-a-Service platforms.

### ✅ Used

- **PostgreSQL** – Primary relational database for all enterprise data.
- **Prisma ORM** – Type-safe database access, schema management, and migrations.
- **JWT Authentication** – Secure authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **PostgreSQL-backed Data Storage** – Stores users, departments, assets, bookings, maintenance records, audit logs, notifications, and application metadata.
- **Local Upload Storage (Development)** – Asset images and documents are stored locally, while their metadata is managed in PostgreSQL via Prisma.
